PROBLEM: SALES TAXES<br />
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical<br />
products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods<br />
at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.<br />
When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price<br />
(including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes<br />
paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains<br />
(np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.<br />
